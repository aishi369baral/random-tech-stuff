#### Difference between System Design & Clean Architecture:
#### 1. System Design
```│
├── High-level architecture (services, DB, cache, APIs)
│
└── Application Design
    └── Clean Architecture```

- **System design decides =** WHAT components exist || about designing scable systems.
- **Clean Architecture decides** = HOW code inside a component is written || is about structuring code inside a service for testability, maintainability and scalibility by separation of concerns.
